A congenial soil for the action of Phos. acid is found in young people who grow rapidly, and who are overtaxed, mentally or physically. Whenever the system has been exposed to the ravages of acute disease, excesses, grief, loss of vital fluids, we obtain conditions calling for it. Pyrosis, flatulence, diarrhoea, diabetes, rhachitis and periosteal inflammation. Neurosis in stump, after amputation. Hemorrhages in typhoid. Useful in relieving pain of cancer.",
