  "details": "Its primary function is to stimulate the motor centers and the reflex action of the spinal cord. Homeopathic to spasms of muscles, cramps from an undue reflex excitability of the cord, spasms of the bladder, etc. Strychnine stimulates the central nervous system, mental activities, special senses rendered more acute. Respiration increased. All reflexes are made more active. Stiffness in muscles and face and neck. Opisthotonos. Tetanic convulsions with opisthotonos. The muscles relax between paroxysms; worse slightest touch, sound, odor. Influences more directly the spinal cord and is less appropriate in visceral derangements than Nux. TETANUS. Explosive nervousness. The pains and sensations come SUDDENLY and return at INTERVALS. Gastric atony; STRYCHN. VALERIN. Exhaustion of brain-power; women of high nervous erethism; 2x trit.", 
  "dosage": "Third to thirtieth potency. For non-homeopathic use, to produce its direct physiological effects in paralysis the dose will range from one-fiftieth to one-twentieth of a grain, repeated three times a day. Under twelve years of age, one-fiftieth to one-hundredth of a grain. STRYCHN., hypodermically, is capable of arresting progressive muscular atrophy, and is a certain stimulant to the respiratory centers, and is useful in embarrassed breathing, in the course of pneumonia especially. Is an antidote to Chloral, used in asphyxia from gas and chloroform and early stages of Opium poisoning. Dose, one one-hundredth to one-sixtieth grain every three hours."
