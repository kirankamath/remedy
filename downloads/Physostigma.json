  "name": "Physostigma", 
  "Relationship": "Compare: ESERINE - the alkaloid of Physostigma - (slows action of heart and increases arterial tension; in ciliary spasm and spasmodic ASTIGMATISM due to irregular action of ciliary muscles; blepharo-spasms; PUPILS CONTRACTED. Twitching of lids, soreness of eyeballs, blurring of vision AFTER USING EYES, pains around eyes and head). Used locally to contract the pupil. ESERINE contracts the pupils dilated by ATROPINE, but not those dilated by GELSEMIUM. Internally 6X. ESERIN SALICYLATE (post-operative intestinal paralysis; meteorism. Hypodermically 1/60-1/40 gr). Compare also: MUSCARIN; CONIUM; CURARE; GELS.; THEBAINUM (tetanus); PIPERAZINUM - (Uric acid conditions. Pruritus. Gout and urinary calculi. CONSTANT BACKACHE. Skin dry, urine scanty. Rheumatic arthritis. Give one grain daily in carbonated water. First and second decimal trituration three times a day.) Antidote: ATROPIA. In full medicinal doses will relieve most of the effects of PHYSOSTIGMINE.",

  "details": "This remedy and its active principle, ESERINE, form a valuable addition to Materia Medica. Stimulates heart, raises blood pressure, and increases peristalsis. Causes contraction of the pupil and of the ciliary muscles. Induces a condition of short-sightedness. SPINAL IRRITATION, loss of motility, prostration, with very sensitive vertebrae. Fibrillary tremors. Rigidity of muscles; paralysis. Depresses the motor and reflex activity of the cord and causes loss of sensibility to pain, muscular weakness, followed by complete paralysis, although muscular contractility is not impaired. Paralysis and tremors, chorea. Meningeal irritation, with rigidity of muscles. TETANUS and trismus. Poly myelitis anterior. Eserine is used locally to produce contraction of pupil.", 
  "dosage": "Third potency. The neutral sulphate of Eserine is instilled into the eye, from one-half to four grains to one ounce distilled water, to induce CONTRACTION OF PUPIL, in mydriasis, injuries to the eye, iritis, corneal ulcers, etc."
