  "details": "This remedy and its active principle, ESERINE, form a valuable addition to Materia Medica. Stimulates heart, raises blood pressure, and increases peristalsis. Causes contraction of the pupil and of the ciliary muscles. Induces a condition of short-sightedness. SPINAL IRRITATION, loss of motility, prostration, with very sensitive vertebrae. Fibrillary tremors. Rigidity of muscles; paralysis. Depresses the motor and reflex activity of the cord and causes loss of sensibility to pain, muscular weakness, followed by complete paralysis, although muscular contractility is not impaired. Paralysis and tremors, chorea. Meningeal irritation, with rigidity of muscles. TETANUS and trismus. Poly myelitis anterior. Eserine is used locally to produce contraction of pupil.",
