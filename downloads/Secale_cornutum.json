  "details": "Produces contraction of the un striped muscular fibers; hence a constringent feeling throughout the whole body. This produces an anaemic condition, coldness, numbness, petechiae, mortification, gangrene. A useful remedy for old people with shriveled skin - thin, scrawny old women. All the Secale conditions are BETTER FROM COLD; the whole body is pervaded by a sense of great heat. Hemorrhages; continued oozing; THIN, fetid, watery black blood. DEBILITY, ANXIETY, EMACIATION, THOUGH APPETITE AND THIRST MAY BE EXCESSIVE. Facial and abdominal muscles twitch. Secale decreases the flow of pancreatic juice by raising the blood pressure. (Hinsdale).", 
  "dosage": "First to thirtieth potency. NON-HOMEOPATHIC USE. If hemorrhages of the puerperium, after the uterus is entirely emptied, when it fails to contract satisfactorily and in secondary puerperal hemorrhage the result of incomplete involution of the uterus, give one-half to one dram of the fluid extract. Remember Pagot's law, As long as the uterus contains anything, be it child, placenta, membranes, clots, never administer Ergot."
