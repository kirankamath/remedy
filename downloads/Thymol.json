Carbon tetrachloride is a vermifuge and vermicide of great potency, and has shown itself to be the best vermifuge for the treatment of hookworm in a country where the disease predominates.\"2. It gives little discomfort to the patient, is palatable, required no preparation of the patient, and when pure is apparently not toxic - all of which features are of advantage in a popular campaign.\"W. G. Smillie, and S.B. Pessoa, of Sao Paulo, Brazil, also have found carbon tetrachloride to be extremely efficient in removing hookworms. A single dose of 3 Cc. given to adults has been proved to remove 95 per cent. of all the hookworms harbored.\"",
