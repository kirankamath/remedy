  "details": "Acts on circular muscular fibers, hence constrictions. It is the heart and arteries especially that at once respond to the influence of Cactus, producing very characteristic CONSTRICTIONS as of an iron band. This sensation is found in various places, oesophagus, bladder, etc. The mental symptoms produced correspond to those found when there are heart affections, sadness, and melancholy. HEMORRHAGE, CONSTRICTIONS, PERIODICITY, and SPASMODIC PAINS. Whole body feels as if caged, each wire being twisted tighter. Atheromatous arteries and weak heart. Congestions; irregular distribution of blood. FAVORS FORMATION OF CLOTS SPEEDILY. Great periodicity. Toxic goitre with cardiac symptoms. Cactus is pulse-less, panting and prostrated.",
