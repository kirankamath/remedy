  "symptoms": {}, 
  "name": "Muscarinum", 
  "details": "The alkaloid of Agaricus has much power over secretions, increasing lachrymal, salivary, hepatic, etc., but diminishing renal; probably neurotic in origin, stimulating the terminal fibres of the secretory nerves of all these structures, hence SALIVATION, LACHRYMATION AND EXCESSIVE PERSPIRATION. ATROPIA exactly opposes MUSCARINE. Resembles Pilocarpine in action."
