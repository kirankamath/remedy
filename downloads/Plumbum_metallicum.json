  "details": "Delirium, coma and convulsions. Hypertension and arteriosclerosis. PROGRESSIVE MUSCULAR ATROPHY. Infantile paralysis. Locomotor ataxia. Excessive and rapid emaciation. Bulbar paralysis. Important in peripheral affections. The points of attack for Plumbum are the neuraxons and the anterior horns. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis, posterior spinal sclerosis. Contractions and boring pain. All the symptoms of acute Nephritis with amaurosis and cerebral symptoms. GOUT. (Chronic).The great drug for general sclerotic conditions. Lead paralysis is chiefly of extensors, forearm or upper limb, from center to periphery with partial anesthesia or excessive hyperesthesia, preceded by pain. Localized neuralgic pains, neuritis. The blood, alimentary and nervous systems are the special seats of action of Plumbum. Haematosis is interfered with, rapid reduction in number of red corpuscles; hence pallor, icterus, anaemia. Constrictive sensation in internal organs.",
