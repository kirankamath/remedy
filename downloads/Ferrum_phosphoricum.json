  "details": "In the early stages of febrile conditions, it stands midway between sthenic activity of Aconite and Bell, and the asthenic sluggishness and torpidity of GELS. The typical FERR. PHOS. subject is not full blooded and robust, but nervous, sensitive, anaemic with the false plethora and easy flushing of Ferrum. Prostration marked; face more active than GELS. The superficial redness never assumes the dusky hue of GELS. Pulse soft and flowing; no anxious restlessness of ACON. Susceptibility to chest troubles. Bronchitis of young children. In acute exacerbation of tuberculosis, a fine palliative of wonderful power. Corresponds to Grauvogl's Oxygenoid Constitution, the inflammatory, febrile, emaciating, wasting consumption.The remedy for first stage of all febrile disturbances and inflammations before exudation sets in; especially for catarrhal affections of the respiratory tract. FERR. PHOS. 3x increases haemoglobin. In pale, anaemic subjects, with violent local congestions. Hemorrhages, bright from any orifice.",
