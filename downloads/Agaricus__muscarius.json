  "Relationship": "Compare: MUSCARINE, the alkaloid of Agaricus (has much power over secretions, increasing lachrymal, salivary, hepatic, etc., but diminishing renal; probably neurotic in origin, stimulating the terminal fibres of the secretory nerves of all these structures, hence SALIVATION, LACHRYMATION AND EXCESSIVE PERSPIRATION. ATROPIA exactly opposes MUSCARINE. Resembles Pilocarpine in action.) AMANITA VERNUS - spring mushroom - a variety of AGARICUS PHALLOIDES - Death cup - active principle is PHALLIN active like Muscarine. AMANITA PHALLOIDES (Death Cup - Deadly Agaric.) The poison is a toxalbumin, resembling the poison in the rattle snake and the poison excreted by the cholera and diphtheria germs. It acts on the red blood corpuscles, dissolving them so that blood escapes into the alimentary canal and the whole system is drained. The amount of this toxic principle is small, even handling of specimens and breathing of spores affects some people unpleasantly. The poison is slow in development. Even 12 to 20 hours after taking it the patient feels all right, but vertigo violent choleraic symptoms with rapid loss of strength with death the second or third day, preceded by stupor and spasms. Fatty degeneration of liver, heart and kidneys, hemorrhages in lungs, pleura and skin (Dr. J. Schier). Vomiting and purging. Continuous urging to stool, but no gastric, abdominal or rectal PAIN. Intense thirst for cold water, dry skin. Lethargic but mentally clear. SHARP CHANGES from rapid to slow and from slow to rapid breathing, extreme collapse, suppressed urine, but NO cold extremities or cramps.) AGARIC. EMET. (severe vertigo; all symptoms BETTER, COLD WATER; LONGING FOR ICE-WATER; gastritis cold sweat, vomiting sensation as if stomach was suspended on a string. TAMUS (chilblains and freckles).

  "details": "This fungus contains several toxic compounds, the best known of which is MUSCARIN. The symptoms of poisoning do not develop at once, usually twelve to fourteen hours elapse before the initial attack. There is no antidote, treatment, entirely symptomatic. (Schneider). Agaricus acts as an intoxicant to the brain, producing more vertigo and delirium than alcohol, followed by profound sopor with lowered reflexes.Jerking, twitching, trembling, and itching are strong indications. Incipient phthisis; is related to the tubercular diathesis, anaemia, CHOREA, twitching ceases during sleep. Various forms of neuralgia and spasmodic affections, and neurotic skin troubles are pictured in the symptomatology of this remedy. It corresponds to various forms of cerebral excitement rather than congestion. Thus, in delirium of fevers, alcoholism, etc. General paralysis. SENSATIONS IF PIERCED BY NEEDLES OF ICE. Sensitive to pressure and cold air. VIOLENT BEARING-DOWN PAINS. Symptoms appear diagonally as RIGHT ARM AND LEFT LEG. Pains are accompanied by sensation of cold, numbness and tingling.",
