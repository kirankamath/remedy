  "name": "Cannibis indica", 
  "Relationship": "Bellad.; Hyoscy.; Stram.; Laches.; Agaric.; Anhalonium (time sense disordered; time periods enormously overestimated; thus, minutes seem hours, etc.).", 
  "details": "Inhibits the higher faculties and stimulates the imagination to a remarkable degree without any marked stimulation of the lower or animal instinct. A condition of INTENSE EXALTATION, in which all perceptions and conceptions, all sensations and emotions are exaggerated to the utmost degree. Subconscious or DUAL NATURE STATE. Apparently under the control of the second self, but, the original self, prevents the performance of acts which are under the domination of the second self. Apparently the two natures cannot act independently, one acting as a check, upon the other. (Effects of one Dram doses by Dr. Albert Schneider.) The experimenter feels ever and anon that he is distinct from the subject of the hashish dream and can think rationally. Produces the most remarkable hallucinations and imaginations, EXAGGERATION OF THE DURATION OF TIME AND EXTENT OF SPACE, BEING MOST CHARACTERISTIC. Conception of time, space and place is gone. Extremely happy and contented, nothing troubles. Ideas crowd upon each other. Has great soothing influence in many nervous disorders, like epilepsy, mania, dementia, delirium tremens, and irritable reflexes. Exophthalmic goitre. Catalepsy."
