  "details": "Sensation of weakness, dragging and in the sacrum and pelvis, with great languor and prostration, are excellent indications for this remedy. There is a sensitiveness expressed as a consciousness of a womb. Tired, back achy females. The weakness shows itself also in a tendency to prolapse and other malposition of the womb. The menses are often suppressed and the kidneys congested. It seems as if the monthly congestion, instead of venting itself as it should through the uterine vessels, had extended to the kidneys. With it all, there is a profound melancholia. Patient must be doing something to engage the mind. Remember it, for women with prolapsus from atony, enervated by indolence and luxury (better when attention is engaged - hence when the doctor comes), or for those worn out with hard work; tired, strained muscles burn and ache; sleepless. Diabetes mellitus, and insipidus. Constant aching and tenderness over kidneys.",
