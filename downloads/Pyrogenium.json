  "details": "Pyrogen is the great remedy for SEPTIC STATES, with intense restlessness. In septic fevers, especially puerperal, Pyrogen has demonstrated its great value as a homeopathic dynamic antiseptic. (H. C. Allen.) Hectic, typhoid, typhus, ptomaine poisoning, diphtheria, dissecting wounds, sewer-gas poisoning, chronic malaria, after-effects of miscarriage, all these conditions at times may present symptoms calling for this unique medicine. ALL DISCHARGES ARE HORRIBLY OFFENSIVE - menstrual, lochial, diarrhoea, vomit, sweat, breath, etc. Great pain and violent burning in abscesses. Chronic complaints that date back to septic conditions. Threatening heart failure in zymotic and septic fevers. Influenza, typhoid symptoms.This remedy was introduced by English Homeopathists, prepared from decomposed lean beef allowed to stand in the sun for two weeks and then potentised. The provings and most of the clinical experience have been obtained from this preparation. But, subsequently, Dr. Swan potentised some septic pus, which preparation has also been proved and clinically applied. There does not seem to be any marked difference in their effects.",
