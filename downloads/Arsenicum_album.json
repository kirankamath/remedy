Burning relieved by heat. SEASIDE COMPLAINTS (Nat-mur.; Aqua Marina)). Injurious effects of fruits, especially more watery ones. Gives quiet and ease to the last moments of life when given in high potency. FEAR FRIGHT AND WORRY. Green discharges. Infantile Kala-azar. (Dr. Neatby). ARS. should be thought of in ailments from alcoholism, PTOMAINE POISONING, stings, dissecting wounds, chewing tobacco; ill effects from decayed food or animal matter; odor of discharges is PUTRID; in complaints that return annually. Anaemia and chlorosis. Degenerative changes. Gradual loss of weight from impaired nutrition. Reduces the refractive index of blood serum (also China and Ferr. phos.).
