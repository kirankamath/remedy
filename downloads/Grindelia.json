  "details": "Both Grindelia robusta and Grindelia squarrosa have been used for the symptoms here recorded. There is practically no difference in their action, although the G. Squarrosa is credited with more SPLENIC symptoms, dull pains and fullness in left hypochondrium; chronic malaria; gastric pains associated with splenic congestion. Induces paralysis, beginning in extremities. Its action is shown on the heart first quickening, then retarding it. Acts on the cardiopulmonary distribution of the pneumo gastric in dry catarrh (tart Emetic in mucopurulent). Produces a paresis of the pneumogastric, interfering with respiration. SMOTHERING AFTER FALLING ASLEEP. Asthmatic conditions, chronic bronchitis. Bronchorrhea with tough mucus, difficult to detach. Raises the blood pressure. Nausea and retching of gastric ulcer. Sugar in urine An effective antidote to Rhus-poisoning, locally and internally; also for burns, blisters, vaginal catarrh and herpes zoster. Hyperchlorhydria when attended with asthmatic and other neurotic symptoms. Hyperaemia of gastric mucous membrane with difficult respiration.",
