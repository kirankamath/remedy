Blood extravasations; FATTY DEGENERATIONS, cirrhosis, caries, are pathological states often calling for Phosphorus. Muscular pseudo-hypertrophy, neuritis. Inflammation of the respiratory tract. Paralytic symptoms. Ill effects of Iodine and excessive use of salt; worse, LYING ON LEFT SIDE. Tertiary syphilis, skin lesions, and nervous debility. SCURVY. PSEUDO-HYPERTROPHIC PARALYSIS.
