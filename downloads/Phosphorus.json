Blood extravasations; FATTY DEGENERATIONS, cirrhosis, caries, are pathological states often calling for Phosphorus. Muscular pseudo-hypertrophy, neuritis. Inflammation of the respiratory tract. Paralytic symptoms. Ill effects of Iodine and excessive use of salt; worse, LYING ON LEFT SIDE. Tertiary syphilis, skin lesions, and nervous debility. SCURVY. PSEUDO-HYPERTROPHIC PARALYSIS.

Bone fragility.Phosphorus irritates, inflames and degenerates mucous membranes, irritates and inflames serous membranes, inflames spinal cord and nerves, causing paralysis, destroys bone, especially the lower jaw and tibia; disorganizes the blood, causing fatty degeneration of blood vessels and every tissue and organ of the body and thus gives rise to hemorrhages, and hematogenous jaundice.",
