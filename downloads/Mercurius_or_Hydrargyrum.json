  "details": "Every organ and tissue of the body is more or less affected by this powerful drug; it transforms healthy cells into decrepit, inflamed and necrotic wrecks, decomposes the blood, producing a profound anemia. This malignant medicinal force is converted into useful life saving and life preserving service if employed homeopathically, guided by its clear cut symptoms. The lymphatic system is especially affected with all the membranes and GLANDS, and internal organs, bones, etc. Lesions produced by mercury very similar to those of syphilis. Very often indicated in the SECONDARY stage of syphilis when there is a febrile chloro-anaemia, rheumatoid pains behind sternum, around joints, etc.; ulceration of mouth and throat, etc. These are the special conditions and stages to which Mercur is homeopathic and where the 2X will do surprising work. Again, hereditary syphilis manifestations, are within its range; bullae, abscesses, snuffles, marasmus, stomatitis or destructive inflammations. TREMORS everywhere. Weakness with ebullitions and tremblings from least exertion. All mercury symptoms are WORSE AT NIGHT, from warmth of bed, from damp, cold, rainy weather, WORSE DURING PERSPIRATION. Complaints increase with the sweat and rest; all associated with a great deal of weariness, prostration, and trembling. A human \"thermometer.\" Sensitive to heat and cold. Parts are much swollen, with raw, sore feeling; the profuse, oily perspiration does not relieve. BREATH, excretions of the body smell foul. Tendency to formation of pus, which is thin, greening, putrid; streaked with blood."
