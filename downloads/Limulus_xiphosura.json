  "details": "Limulus was introduced by C. Hering and partially proved by him and Lippe. Hering was surprised to see the blood of the King crab that he dissected, blue, which on investigation, was found to contain copper as he had surmised and which he thought would prove to be another medicine for Cholera. Further provings are necessary to establish this, though symptoms so far observed make this probable. Hering's fertile mind always lead him to pioneer paths into practical therapeutics. Bodily and mental exhaustion; drowsiness AFTER SEA BATHING.", 
  "dosage": "Sixth potency."
