  "details": "The Anacardium patient is found mostly among the neurasthenics; such have a type of nervous dyspepsia, relieved by food; IMPAIRED MEMORY, depression, and irritability; diminution of senses (smell, sight, hearing). Syphilitic patients often suffer with these conditions. Intermittency of symptoms. Fear of examination in students. Weakening of all senses, sight, hearing, etc. Aversion to work; lacks self-confidence; irresistible desire to swear and curse. SENSATION OF A PLUG in various parts - eyes, rectum, bladder, etc.; also of a band. Empty feeling in stomach; EATING TEMPORARILY RELIEVES ALL DISCOMFORT. This is a sure indication, often verified. Its skin symptoms are similar to Rhus, and it has proved a valuable antidote to Poison-Oak.",
