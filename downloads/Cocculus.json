  "details": "Within the sphere of action of Cocculus are many spasmodic, and paretic affections, notably those affecting one-half of the body. Affects the cerebrum, will not cure convulsive seizures proceeding from the spinal cord. (A. E. Hinsdale.) PAINFUL CONTRACTURE of limbs and trunk; tetanus. Many of the evil EFFECTS OF NIGHT-WATCHING are relieved by it. It shows a special attraction FOR LIGHT-HAIRED FEMALES, especially during pregnancy, causing much nausea and backache. Unmarried and childless women, sensitive and romantic girls, etc. All its symptoms are worse riding in a carriage or on shipboard; hence its use in seasickness. Sensation of HOLLOWNESS, or emptiness, as if parts had gone to sleep. Feels too weak to talk loud.",
