  "details": "This is the great Hahnemannian anti-psoric. Its action is centrifugal - from within outward - having an elective affinity for the skin, where it produces heat and BURNING, with itching; made worse by heat of bed. Inertia and relaxation of fiber; hence feebleness of tone characterizes its symptoms. EBULLITIONS OF HEAT, DISLIKE OF WATER, DRY AND HARD HAIR AND SKIN, RED ORIFICES, SINKING FEELING AT STOMACH ABOUT eleven AM, AND CAT-NAP SLEEP; always indicate Sulphur homeopathically. STANDING IS the worse position for sulphur patients, it is always uncomfortable. Dirty, filthy people, prone to skin affections. Aversion to being washed. WHEN CAREFULLY-SELECTED REMEDIES FAIL TO ACT, ESPECIALLY IN ACUTE DISEASES; it frequently arouses the reactionary powers of the organism. COMPLAINTS THAT RELAPSE. GENERAL OFFENSIVE CHARACTER OF DISCHARGE AND EXHALATIONS. Very red lips and face, flushing easily. Often great use in beginning the treatment of chronic cases and in finishing acute ones.",
  "Natural History": [
    "Sublimated Sulphur"
  ],
  "dosage": "Acts in all potencies from the lowest to the highest. Some of the best results are obtained from the higher, and not too frequent doses. The twelfth potency is a good one to begin treatment with, going higher or lower according to the susceptibility of the patient. In chronic diseases, 200th and upward. In TORPID eruptions the LOWEST potencies."
