It prefers the right side, the evening, and open air, warm weather after cold days, to manifest its action most markedly.Children dislike to be carried or raised. PHYSICAL WEAKNESS, all-pervading apathy. Complaints apt to develop slowly.Acts on all serous membranes and the viscera they contain. Aching in every muscle. The general character OF THE PAIN HERE PRODUCED IS A STITCHING, TEARING; WORSE BY MOTION, BETTER REST. These characteristic stitching pains, greatly aggravated by any motion, are found everywhere, but especially in the chest; worse pressure. MUCOUS MEMBRANES ARE ALL DRY. The Bryonia patient is irritable; has vertigo from raising the head, pressive headache; dry, parched lips, mouth; excessive thirst, bitter taste, sensitive epigastrium, and feeling of a stone in the stomach; stools large, dry, hard; dry cough; rheumatic pains and swellings; dropsical effusions into synovial and serous membranes.",
