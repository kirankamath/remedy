  "details": "Bryonia affects especially the constitution of a robust, firm fiber and dark complexion, with tendency to leanness and irritability. It prefers the right side, the evening, and open air, warm weather after cold days, to manifest its action most markedly.Children dislike to be carried or raised. PHYSICAL WEAKNESS, all-pervading apathy. Complaints apt to develop slowly.Acts on all serous membranes and the viscera they contain. Aching in every muscle. The general character OF THE PAIN HERE PRODUCED IS A STITCHING, TEARING; WORSE BY MOTION, BETTER REST. These characteristic stitching pains, greatly aggravated by any motion, are found everywhere, but especially in the chest; worse pressure. MUCOUS MEMBRANES ARE ALL DRY. The Bryonia patient is irritable; has vertigo from raising the head, pressive headache; dry, parched lips, mouth; excessive thirst, bitter taste, sensitive epigastrium, and feeling of a stone in the stomach; stools large, dry, hard; dry cough; rheumatic pains and swellings; dropsical effusions into synovial and serous membranes.",
