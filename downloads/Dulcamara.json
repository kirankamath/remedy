  "details": "Hot days and cold nights toward the close of summer are especially favorable to the action of Dulcamara, and is one of the remedies that correspond in their symptoms to the conditions found as effects of damp weather, colds after exposure to wet, especially diarrhoea. It has a specific relation also to the SKIN, GLANDS, and digestive organs, MUCOUS MEMBRANES secreting more profusely while the skin is inactive. The RHEUMATIC TROUBLES induced by damp cold are aggravated by every cold change and somewhat relieved by moving about. Results from sitting on cold, damp ground. Icy coldness. One-sided spasms with speechlessness. Paralysis of single parts. Congestive headache, with neuralgia and dry nose. Patients living or working in damp, cold basements. (NAT-SULPH.) Eruptions on hands, arms or face around the menstrual period.",
