  "details": "Hahnemann says: \"The action of this substance is very puzzling and difficult of investigation, even in the healthy organism because its PRIMARY ACTION, more frequently than with any other remedy, alternates and becomes intermixed with the vital reactions (after effects) of the organism. On this account it is often difficult to determine what belongs to the vital reactions of the body and WHAT TO THE ALTERNATING EFFECTS DUE TO THE PRIMARY ACTION OF THE CAMPHOR.\" Pictures a state of collapse. ICY COLDNESS of the whole body; sudden sinking of strength; pulse small and weak. After operations, if temperature is subnormal, low blood pressure, 3 doses Camph. 1x, 15-minute intervals. This condition is met with in cholera, and here it is that Camphor has achieved classical fame. FIRST STAGES OF A COLD, WITH CHILLINESS AND SNEEZING. Subsultus and extreme restlessness.
