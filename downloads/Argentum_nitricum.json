  "details": "In this drug the neurotic effects are very marked, many brain and spinal symptoms presenting themselves which give certain indications for its homeopathic employment. Symptoms of incoordination, loss of control and want of balance everywhere, mentally and physically; TREMBLING in affected parts. Is an irritant of mucous membranes, producing violent inflammation of the throat, and a marked gastroenteritis. Very characteristic is the great DESIRE FOR SWEETS, the splinter-like pains, and free mucopurulent discharge in the inflamed and ulcerated mucous membranes. Sensation as if a part were expanding and other errors of perception are characteristic. Withered up and dried constitutions present a favorable field for its action, especially when associated with unusual or long continued mental exertion. Head symptoms often determine the choice of this remedy. Pains increase and decrease gradually. Flatulent state and prematurely aged look. Explosive belching, especially in neurotics. Upper abdominal affections brought on by undue mental exertion. Paraplegia Myelitis and disseminated sclerosis of brain and cord. INTOLERANCE OF HEAT. Sensation of a sudden pinch (Dudgeon). Destroys red blood corpuscles, producing anemia.", 
  "dosage": "Third to thirtieth potency. Best form an aqueous solution 1 to 9, 2 or 3 drop doses. This solution in water preferable to lower triturations; unless fresh, these readily decompose"
