ACUTE, SUDDEN, AND VIOLENT INVASION, WITH FEVER, call for it. Does not want to be touched. Sudden and great sinking of strength. Complaints and tension caused by exposure to DRY, COLD WEATHER, draft of cold air, checked perspiration, also complaints from VERY HOT WEATHER, especially gastrointestinal disturbances, etc. First remedy in inflammation, inflammatory fevers. Serous membranes and muscular tissues affected markedly. Burning in internal parts; TINGLING, COLDNESS AND NUMBNESS. Influenza. TENSION of arteries; emotional and physical mental tension explain many symptoms. When prescribing Aconite remember Aconite causes only functional disturbance, no evidence that it can produce tissue change - its action is brief and SHOWS NO PERIODICITY. Its sphere is in the beginning of an acute disease and not to be continued after pathological change comes. In Hyperaemia, congestion not after exudation has set in. INFLUENZA (Influenzin).", 
  "Natural History": "Monkshood", 
  "dosage": "Sixth potency for sensory affections; first to third for congestive conditions. Must be repeated frequently in acute diseases. Acon. is a rapid worker. In Neuralgias tincture of the root often preferable, one drop doses (poisonous), or again, the 30th potency according to susceptibility of patient."
