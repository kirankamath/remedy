Excess of venosity.The main action of Thuja is on the skin and genitourinary organs, producing conditions that correspond with Hahnemann's sycotic dyscrasia, whose chief manifestation is the formation of wart-like excrescences upon mucous and cutaneous surfaces - fig-warts and condylomata. Has a specific antibacterial action, as in gonorrhea and vaccination. Sycotic pains, i.e., tearing in muscles and joints, worse at rest, better in dry weather, worse damp humid atmosphere; lameness. HYDROGENOID CONSTITUTIONS, whose blood is morbidly hydroscopic, so that damp air and water are inimical. Complaints from moonlight. RAPID EXHAUSTION AND EMACIATION. Left-sided and chilly medicine.
